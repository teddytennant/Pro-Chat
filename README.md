## Design Philosophy

Pro-Chat is designed for individual users who prefer keyboard-driven workflows. The interface is clean and distraction-free, inspired by OpenWebUI's design principles but focused on personal use rather than team collaboration. Every feature is accessible without touching the mouse, and the UI stays out of your way while you focus on the conversation.

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support ES6+ JavaScript and CSS Grid/Flexbox.
